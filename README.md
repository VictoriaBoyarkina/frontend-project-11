## Description

RSS (Really Simple Syndication) feeds provide news headlines, brief article descriptions, and links in an xml file that is automatically updated whenever those headlines change. This information is fetched by a user’s RSS feed reader that converts the files and the latest updates from websites into an easy to read format. An RSS feed takes the headlines, summaries, and update notices, and then links back to articles on your favorite website’s page.
